This is a simple Flask app for IPL Prediction using Ridge Regression. The model takes Venue, Batting Team, Bowling Team, Overs, Runs after 6 overs(min), wickets after 6 overs(min), Runs scored in previous 5 overs, and Wickets taken in previous 5 overs as an input and predict the final score of the batting team.
